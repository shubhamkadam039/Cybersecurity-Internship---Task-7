## Interview Question Responses

### 1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?

Browser extensions operate with elevated privileges that allow them to access browsing data, modify web pages, intercept communications, and potentially steal sensitive information. Key risks include:

- **Data Theft**: Extensions can steal passwords, browsing history, cookies, and personal information
- **Session Hijacking**: Malicious extensions can steal authentication tokens and session data
- **Code Injection**: Extensions can inject malicious scripts into legitimate websites
- **Network Interception**: Extensions can monitor and modify network traffic
- **Credential Harvesting**: Extensions with clipboard access can steal copied passwords
- **Malware Distribution**: Extensions can download and install additional malicious software

*Recent examples include the 2025 campaign affecting 35 Chrome extensions with 2.6 million users, where attackers injected code to steal Facebook advertising credentials.*

### 2. What permissions should raise suspicion?

Suspicious permissions that warrant careful evaluation include:

- **"Read and change all your data on websites you visit"** - Especially for simple utilities
- **Access to browsing history** for extensions that don't need it
- **Clipboard access** for non-productivity tools  
- **Cookie and authentication data access**
- **Ability to execute scripts on all websites**
- **Access to tabs and navigation data** for single-purpose tools
- **Storage permissions** exceeding functional requirements
- **Host permissions** covering all domains (*://*/*)

*The key question: Does this extension truly need these permissions for its stated functionality?*

### 3. How to safely install browser extensions?

Safe installation practices include:

- **Official Stores Only**: Install exclusively from Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, or Edge Add-ons
- **Developer Verification**: Research developer reputation and history
- **Review Analysis**: Read user reviews carefully, especially recent negative feedback
- **Permission Scrutiny**: Analyze requested permissions before installation
- **Download Statistics**: Be cautious of extensions with unusually high downloads but poor reviews
- **Update Recency**: Avoid abandoned extensions (not updated in 12+ months)
- **Minimal Installation**: Only install extensions you actively need
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and remove unused extensions

### 4. What is extension sandboxing?

Extension sandboxing is a security mechanism that isolates extensions in restricted environments to prevent malicious code from affecting other browser processes or the entire system. Key aspects:

- **Process Isolation**: Each extension runs in its own isolated process
- **Resource Limitations**: Sandboxed extensions have limited access to system resources
- **API Restrictions**: Extensions can only access approved browser APIs
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents execution of inline scripts and eval()
- **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: Limits extension access to different domains
- **Privilege Separation**: Different extension components run with minimal necessary privileges

*Chrome's manifest V3 enhanced sandboxing by removing support for remotely hosted code and requiring service workers instead of background pages.*

### 5. Can extensions steal passwords?

Yes, extensions can steal passwords through multiple vectors:

- **DOM Access**: Extensions with site access can read password input fields
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Extensions with clipboard permissions can steal copied passwords
- **Network Interception**: Extensions can intercept login form submissions
- **Session Token Theft**: Extensions can steal authentication cookies and tokens
- **Keylogging**: Malicious extensions can monitor keyboard inputs
- **Password Manager Interference**: Extensions can intercept communications between password managers and websites

*Recent incidents like the 2023 password-stealing Chrome extension and the 2025 Facebook credential harvesting campaign demonstrate active exploitation of these capabilities.*

### 6. How to update extensions securely?

Secure extension updating practices:

- **Automatic Updates**: Enable automatic updates through browser settings when possible
- **Official Channels**: Only update through official browser stores
- **Permission Reviews**: Check if updates request new permissions
- **Release Notes**: Read update descriptions for security fixes
- **Developer Communication**: Verify major updates through official developer channels  
- **Staging Environment**: Test critical extensions in isolated environments first
- **Backup Strategy**: Document current extension versions before updates
- **Monitor Behavior**: Watch for unusual behavior after updates

*Be especially cautious of extensions that suddenly request new permissions during updates, as this is a common sign of compromise.*

### 7. Difference between extensions and plugins?

**Extensions:**
- Browser add-ons that enhance functionality within the browser environment
- Run using browser APIs and JavaScript
- Sandboxed within browser security model
- Examples: Ad blockers, password managers, productivity tools
- Managed through browser extension systems

**Plugins:**
- External programs that integrate with browsers to handle specific content types  
- Often native code running outside browser sandbox
- Examples: Flash Player, Java applets, PDF viewers
- Generally being phased out due to security concerns
- Require separate installation and maintenance

*Modern browsers are moving away from plugins in favor of extensions and web standards due to security and stability improvements.*

### 8. How to report malicious extensions?

Reporting procedures for malicious extensions:

**Chrome Web Store:**
- Use "Report abuse" option on extension page
- Contact Chrome Enterprise support for business environments
- Report to Google Safe Browsing: safebrowsing.google.com

**Firefox Add-ons:**
- Use "Report this add-on" on extension page  
- Email amo-admins@mozilla.org for urgent issues
- Contact Mozilla Security Team for vulnerabilities

**General Reporting:**
- Submit to cybersecurity research communities
- Report to antivirus vendors for database updates
- Share IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) with security teams
- Document findings for industry threat intelligence

*Include extension ID, version number, malicious behavior details, and supporting evidence when reporting.*
